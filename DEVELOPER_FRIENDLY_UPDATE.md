# 🎯 VibeWolf Security Scanner - Developer-Friendly Update

## 🧠 **THE INSIGHT**

**User Feedback:** *"We don't want the scanner to be a pain in the ass because as we start to build our apps there will be sensitive data with APIs and passwords... We want Vibe Coders to use this tool later on in development when they are getting close to backend migration and close to putting their apps on the stores."*

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

### **Before (Annoying):**
- ❌ **Real-time scanning enabled by default** - Constant interruptions
- ❌ **Red squiggly lines everywhere** - Distracting during development
- ❌ **Immediate warnings** about APIs/passwords - Kills productivity
- ❌ **Scans on activation** - Unwanted initial scan

### **After (Developer-Friendly):**
- ✅ **Real-time scanning DISABLED by default** - Silent during development
- ✅ **On-demand scanning only** - Scan when YOU decide
- ✅ **No initial scan** - Clean activation without interruption
- ✅ **Updated messaging** - Clear about when to use VibeWolf

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Configuration Update (package.json)**
```json
"securityScanner.enableRealTime": {
  "type": "boolean",
  "default": false,  // Changed from true
  "description": "Enable real-time scanning as you type (disabled by default to avoid interrupting development workflow)"
}
```

### **2. Activation Behavior (extension.ts)**
```typescript
// Before: Always scanned on activation
if (vscode.window.activeTextEditor) {
    scanDocument(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document);
}

// After: Only scan if real-time is explicitly enabled
const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('securityScanner');
if (config.get('enableRealTime', false) && vscode.window.activeTextEditor) {
    scanDocument(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document);
}
```

### **3. Updated Activation Message**
```typescript
// Before: Generic activation message
'🛡️ Windsurf Security Scanner activated!'

// After: Clear guidance on usage
'🐺 VibeWolf Security Scanner ready! Use Command Palette to scan when you\'re ready for deployment.'
```
